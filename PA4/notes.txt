Main thing to keep track of: tranpose at the end 
And also tiling

Thread block of 16x16 is a common choice
Thread blocks must execute independently (must not rely on each other ) because
can be parallel, in sequence we don't know. Gets scheduled along any SM 

Threads WITHIN a block can cooperate by shared memory

Threads in a block run logically in parallel but physically not in parallel
